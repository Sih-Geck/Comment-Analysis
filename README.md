## 📌 **Sentiment Analysis of Comments Received Through E-Consultation Module**

This project focuses on using AI-powered techniques to analyze stakeholder comments submitted through the e-Consultation module on the MCA21 portal.

👉 The core objectives are:

Sentiment Analysis: Classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral.

Summary Generation: Create concise and accurate summaries of lengthy comments.

Word Cloud: Visually highlight the most frequently used keywords in stakeholder feedback.

⚡ The solution will significantly reduce the manual effort required to review a large volume of comments. It will help ensure that all remarks are systematically analyzed, prevent important observations from being overlooked, and provide stakeholders’ feedback in a clear, organized, and actionable manner.
